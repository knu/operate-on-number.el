;;; Commentary:
;;
;; Suppose the point is on some number.  If you want to double it,
;; invoke `operate-on-number-at-point' followed by some keys: * 2 RET.
;;
;; Alternatively, you can bind `apply-operation-to-number-at-point' to
;; <some prefix> *, and you will be able to just type the sequence to
;; double a number, which function uses the last key typed as function
;; specifier and supplies with a default argument which in this case
;; of * is 2.  This command takes numeric argument, so you can type
;; M-3 <some prefix> * to triple the number.
;;
;; For the predefined operation list and how to define a new
;; operation, see `operate-on-number-at-point-alist'.
;;
;; It is recommended using hydra or smartrep to bind the functions like this:
;;
;;   (defhydra hydra-operate-on-number
;;     (global-map "M-=")
;;     "operate-on-number"
;;     ("+"  apply-operation-to-number-at-point)
